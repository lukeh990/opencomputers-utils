A collection of utility scripts for the OpenComputers Minecraft mod on the modpack "FTB Presents SkyFactory 3."

## MSI Model
A spin on the real-world OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model the MSI (Minecraft Systems Interconnection)
model aims to provide a framework that describes how systems communicate.

### Layer 1 - Physical
Much like in the real world, the physical layer is the cabling that connects systems.

Examples:
- Network Cables
- Relay

### Layer 2 - Connection
At this layer, physical addresses are used to address individual network cards. Also, packets must include a port
number which must be open on the receiver.

Examples:
- Network Card
- modem API

### Layer 3 - Network
At this layer, the machine adopts an IPv4 type address (32 bits in 4 octets) which is used to provide best effort delivery.

### Layer 4 - Application
At this layer, the application becomes responsible for structuring data.
